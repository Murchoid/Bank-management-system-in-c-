# Bank-management-system-in-c-
This is a simple project for begginers, a banking system that logs in  user or registers them if the dont  have an account already and performs tasks according to the user's input. The user can either deposit, withdraw or check baolance. I have not finished with the check balance function, try it out and modify it.
